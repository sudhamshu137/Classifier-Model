# Classifier-Model
Machine Learning model for classification based on the dataset given
</br>
This is a machine learning model for predicting the possibility of getting a breast cancer based on the different features given in the dataset</br>
This dataset is used to build 7 machine learning models i.e., classification models:</br></br>

| Classification model | Accuracy Score |
| -------------------- | -------------- |
| Logistic regression  |     0.947      |
|       KNN            |     0.947      |
|   Support Vector     |     0.941      |
|     Kernel SVM       |     0.953      |
|     Naive Bayes      |     0.941      |
|    Decision tree     |     0.953      |
|    Random Forest     |     0.941      |

</br>

As the models Kernel SVM classification and Decision Tree Classification have 95.3% being the highest of all, This dataset can be dealt with these two models.
